Preferences:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon entering the labor market, individuals maximize the discounted present
 value of lifetime earnings.
 Equivalently, individuals maximize the present value of utility derived
 from consumption subject to a lifetime budget constraint with perfect credit
 markets.
 There is no need to specify the utility function.

Calibration Algorithm

\begin_layout Standard
The following parameters are calibrated jointly:

\begin_layout Itemize
human capital technologies: 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s},\delta_{s},\pProduct_{s}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
skill weights: 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{s,\pYear}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy: Compute the equilibrium for each set of parameters.
 Find the parameters that minimize the sum of squared deviations between
 log model wages (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Wage"

\end_inset

) and log median data wages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objective is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D=\sum_{\age=\wageAgeRangeOne}^{\wageAgeRangeLast}\sum_{s=1}^{S}\sum_{\bYear=\bYearFirst}^{\bYearLast}\pWeight_{\age,s,\bYear}\left[\ln\wage_{\age,s,\bYear}-\ln\hat{\wage}_{\age,s,\bYear}\right]^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where it is understood that observations for which data do not exist (
\begin_inset Formula $\pYear\left(\age,\bYear\right)<\wageYearOne$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $>\wageYearLast$
\end_inset

) are dropped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
weighted by the square root of the number of observations in each data cell
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\pWeight\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Skill prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described, the solution would be computationally costly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving the household problem requires skill prices, but deriving skill
 prices from the model parameters requires a solution to the household problem.
 Thus, a fixed point problem would have to be solved for each set of parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reduce the computational cost, the algorithm searches over time paths
 for skill prices instead of skill weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since skill prices are a smooth function of time, they can be approximated
 efficiently by a cubic spline with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nSpNodes$
\end_inset

 nodes for each school group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm then searches for the parameter values that minimizes 
\begin_inset Formula $D+P$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 penalizes skill price paths that are not consistent with constant skill-biased
 technical change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, recover skill weights from aggregate labor supplies and skill
 prices using the aggregate production function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:AggrProdFct"

\end_inset

.
 Construct the penalty function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P=\sum_{s}\sum_{\pYear}resid_{s,\pYear}^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $resid_{s,\pYear}$
\end_inset

 is the residual of an OLS regression of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\skillPrice_{s,\pYear}-\ln\skillPrice_{HSG,\pYear}$
\end_inset

 on a constant time trend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Aggregate labor supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I need to construct aggregate labor supplies in efficiency units; see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:LaborMarket"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difficulty: not all cohorts that contribute to labor supply in the early
 / late data years have model counterparts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In constructing aggregate labor supplies, I assume that cohorts born before
 the earliest model cohort look like the average of the first 5 +++ model
 cohorts.
 Similarly, cohorts born after 
\begin_inset Formula $\bYearLast$
\end_inset

 look like the average of the last 5 +++ model cohorts.
 That is, they have the same 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tEndow$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 profiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I construct 
\begin_inset Formula $\lSupply_{s,\pYear}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:LaborMarket"

\end_inset

 where the mass of persons in each cell 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s,\bYear}$
\end_inset

 is taken directly from the data in the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{N}_{\age,s,\pYear}$
\end_inset

 (which is allowed to vary by age).
 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\age,s,\bYear}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{\age,s,\bYear}$
\end_inset

 are of course generated by the model.

 The curvature of the human capital production function is unusually low.
 Common estimates place 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 near 0.8 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 The calibrated values are between 
\begin_inset Formula $\alphaLow$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alphaHigh$
\end_inset

.
 This may reflect a difference in the way 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is estimated here.
 Earlier work, such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Heckman1976"

\end_inset

 treats the cross-sectional age profile of earnings as representing the
 longitudinal profile for a hypothetical cohort.
 The resulting earnings profile is strongly hump-shaped (see Figure 13 in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Heckman1976"

\end_inset

), which contrasts with the longitudinal profiles observed in CPS data.
 More recent work, such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "HeckmanLochnerT1998"

\end_inset

, uses longitudinal data for a single cohort; in this case the cohort born
 in 1960 and observed until age 35.
 My estimate uses longitudinal wage profiles for several cohorts, most of
 which are observed until age 
\begin_inset Formula $\wageAgeRangeLast$

\begin_layout Standard
The depreciation rate of human capital range from 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddhLow$
\end_inset

% to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddhHigh$
\end_inset

%.
 These are higher than common estimates found in the literature.
 Notably, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "HeckmanLochnerT1998"

\end_inset

 set 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0$
\end_inset

 based on the observation that age-wage profiles seem roughly flat at older
 ages when theory suggests that training investment should be zero.
 Due to the lower value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, training investment remains positive until the agent approaches retirement
 (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:ResultHInvest"

\end_inset

).
 Accounting for roughly flat wages then requires positive depreciation.

Key data feature for both groups: shape of wage profiles changes over time.
 Model replicates these changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is apparent that some of the profiles are not consistent with human capital
 theory and constant skill prices.
 The age profiles for those not college educated are essentially flat.
 Those for college graduates are not concave.
 Note also that the longitudinal wage profiles look very different from
 cross-sectional profiles that are sometimes used in their stead.
 They also look very different from the age wage profiles that sometimes
 estimated using panel data and imposing that a fixed age profile, combined
 with either year effects or cohort effects, characterizes all cohorts (e.g.,

 For all school groups, slopes have a U shape with min near 1950 birth cohort.
 Intercepts decline over most of the period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intercepts and slopes are inversely related.
 During the expansion of U.S.
 education up to the cohorts born in the early 1950s, all wage profiles
 became flatter over time, while their intercepts increased.
 After the early 1950s birth cohorts, U.S.
 education growth essentially stopped.
 During this period, wage profiles became steeper with lower intercepts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model replicates without cohort effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Explain later how this works.
 Roughly: cohorts born in periods of fast skill price growth invest a lot
 in human capital.
 Their wage profiles have low intercepts and high slopes.

\begin_layout Standard
This paper decomposes changes in measured wages into the contributions of
 skill prices and human capital stocks.
 The model implies that unskilled skill prices declined at a far slower
 rate than measured wages.
 One reason is the decline in the mean abilities of unskilled workers that
 results from the expansion of education.
 The model attributes about one-third of the rise in the college wage premium
 to changing worker abilities and human capital investments.
 It attributes about half of the college wage premium in the period around
 2005 to ability selection.

Hours worked per year are defined as the product of hours worked last week
 and weeks worked last year.
 Weeks worked per year are intervalled until 1975.
 Each interval is assigned the average of weeks worked in years after 1975
 in the same interval.
 Until 1975, hours worked per week are only available for the previous week
 (HRSWORK).
 I regress hours worked on years of schooling and a quadratic in experience
 to impute hours worked.
 After 1975, I use usual hours worked per week (UHRSWRK).

Income variables:

\begin_layout Standard
Labor earnings are defined as the sum of wage and salary incomes (INCWAGE).
 Wages are defined as labor earnings divided by hours worked.

 dropped.

Income variables are top-coded.
 As discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 over time.
 In addition, top-coding flags contain obvious errors.
 In most years, fewer than 2% of labor earnings observations appear to be
 top-coded.
 Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
